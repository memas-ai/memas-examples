MeMaS: a Long Term Memory Store for AI Chatbots and Agents

MeMaS, abbreviated from Memory Management Service, is a Long Term Memory Store designed for AI Chatbots and Agents. We offer a simple memory abstraction (`recall` and `memorize`), as well as tools for admins to manage memory.

Why MeMaS?
- MeMaS offers a dedicated solution for chatbot/agent memory. It works out of the box and APIs easy to integrate. MeMaS also saves you the time and effort to implement your own memory.
- MeMaS stores knowledge as well as chat memory, which is useful for Retrieval Augmented Generation and can reduce hallucination. It also reducec the need of fine tuning/retraining.
- By using MeMaS, users can manage what the chatbot knows through Corpuses and Access Control. MeMaS also improves visibility and debuggability, since parts of LLMs are no longer black boxes, as well as fine grain and real time control over even individual chatbots.
