MeMaS, short for Memory Management Service, was created to provide tools to facilitate AI development while also keeping AI 
under control. We are at a point where better and more complex AI models are coming out at an unprecedented pace. 
The models alone, however, are only one piece of the puzzle when it comes to AI applications. 
To provide a more comprehensive and personalized experience, products like AI agents or assistants need the ability to access 
the most relevant specific fragments of their or other "memory" on demand. To address this, we at MeMaS are developing a 
solution that is currently focused on targeted and traceable memory recall for ChatBots. Integrating with the MeMaS service 
offers the developers of AI based applications personalized and controlled memory systems that can be actively or passively 
managed. We have ambitions of expanding beyond memory management to provide other server based functions for AI models that 
elevate their functionality and/or provide administrative control over retrievable information.
