    "# Demo of Integrating MeMaS with ChatGPT\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a simple demo demonstrating one way of integrating MeMaS with ChatGPT. Ultimately, the MeMaS APIs of `memorize` and `recall` were designed to be basic and intuitive; the developers should have a lot freedom in how they want to utilize MeMaS. \n",
    "\n",
    "Think of MeMaS as the memory capabilities in your brain. You spontaneously memorize conversations, textbooks, memes, etc. And when you see a fresh baked apple pie, you may remember how to make an apple pie, but you may also remember your grandma loves to bake apple pies. MeMaS retrieves related information, but usefullness is to be determined by the chatbot/agent."
